    "# Lab 1: Intro to TensorFlow and Music Generation with RNNs\n",
    "## Part 2: Music Generation with RNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, get ready to embark on an exciting journey to explore the realm of music generation using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Inspired by the MIT Introduction to Deep Learning course, I set out to build a system that could compose music in ABC notation, a symbolic music notation system. This notation allows us to represent melodies as text, making it a convenient format for both human interpretation and machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original course materials were provided in TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework. However, I decided to take the initiative to convert the entire project to PyTorch, another widely-used deep learning library known for its dynamic computational graph and ease of use. This conversion not only will broaden our understanding of different machine learning frameworks but will also showcase the flexibility and adaptability required in real-world AI projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, I followed the implementation done by the MIT instructors of a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, a type of RNN particularly well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. The LSTM model was trained on a dataset of ABC notated songs, learning the patterns and structures of musical compositions. I was able to convert the code to PyTorch and fine-tuned various hyperparameters, including the embedding dimensions, number of LSTM units, and learning rates, to optimize the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the project's key features was the ability to generate new musical pieces by feeding a seed sequence into the trained model. The model then predicted subsequent notes, effectively composing new music in real-time. We addressed challenges such as handling multiple time signatures and ensuring the generated music maintained a coherent structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model not only demonstrates the power of deep learning in creative applications but also provides a hands-on example of end-to-end machine learning pipeline development, from data processing and model training to deployment and inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this project, we've gained valuable experience in deep learning, RNNs, music generation, and the practicalities of converting between TensorFlow and PyTorch. This project serves as a testament to the exciting possibilities of AI in the creative arts and the importance of interdisciplinary learning in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.\n",
