    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook is part of the MIT Introduction to Deep Learning course, reimagined using PyTorch, a popular deep learning library known for its dynamic computation graph and ease of use. This lab introduces the user to the basics of PyTorch and demonstrates its application in defining and training neural networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Introduction to PyTorch\n",
    "- **Installation and Setup:** The lab begins with instructions on installing PyTorch and essential dependencies, highlighting PyTorch's straightforward interface and dynamic computational graph capabilities.\n",
    "- **Understanding Tensors:** Students are introduced to tensors in PyTorch, which are similar to multi-dimensional arrays. The lab covers how to create tensors, understand their shapes and ranks, and manipulate them using PyTorch's comprehensive tensor operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: Neural Networks in PyTorch\n",
    "- **Defining Layers and Networks:** The lab explores defining simple neural network layers using `torch.nn.Module` and `torch.nn.Sequential`. It explains how to construct a neural network, focusing on layers like `nn.Linear` for dense (fully connected) layers and `nn.Sigmoid` for activation functions.\n",
    "- **Custom Layers and Subclassing:** The lab dives into creating custom neural network models by subclassing `torch.nn.Module`. This approach provides flexibility for defining custom behaviors, such as unique forward passes and layer configurations.\n",
    "- **Sequential vs. Subclassing:** Students learn the differences between using `nn.Sequential` and subclassing `nn.Module` to build models, understanding the benefits and use cases for each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: Automatic Differentiation and Training\n",
    "- **Autograd for Automatic Differentiation:** The lab covers PyTorch's autograd system, which automatically computes gradients for tensor operations. This feature is essential for training neural networks using backpropagation.\n",
    "- **Gradient Descent Optimization:** Students implement a simple gradient descent optimization algorithm, reinforcing their understanding of how gradients are used to update model parameters and minimize loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Applications and Exercises\n",
    "By the end of the lab, you will have gained a comprehensive understanding of PyTorch, including working with tensors, building neural networks, and leveraging PyTorch's dynamic computation graph for efficient model training. This foundation will equip you with the skills necessary to tackle more complex deep learning tasks and projects using PyTorch.\n"

    "Initialization: We initialize x as a tensor with a random normal value and set requires_grad=True to track operations for automatic differentiation.\n",
    "Loss Function: The loss is defined as (x−xf)2(x−xf​)2, representing the squared difference between the current value of x and the target value x_f.\n",
    "Gradient Computation: loss.backward() computes the gradient of the loss with respect to x. This stores the gradient in x.grad.\n",
    "SGD Update: We update x using the formula x=x−learning_rate×gradx=x−learning_rate×grad. torch.no_grad() is used to prevent PyTorch from tracking this operation, as it is part of the optimization step, not the gradient computation. We then reset the gradient to zero with x.grad.zero_().\n",
    "Plotting: The evolution of x is plotted over the iterations, showing how it converges towards the target value x_f."
